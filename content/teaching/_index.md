In this section, you can find a bunch of learning materials that might be helpful for you. All my teachings focus on three areas:

* English
* Mathematics
* Finance

## English

For people who want to improve their English, here is my suggestion:

* Try to spend at least half an hour each day to immerse yourself in English contexts
* I have prepared a lesson including three parts each week for you to practice your English: _pronunciation, grammar, short story_;
* Follow my instructions or desgin your own learning materials based on resources I have provided, and study them consistently. In one year, I would say that your English would reach to a different level.
* Keep your eyes on this [website](https://github.com/Michael-yunfei/LearnEnglish), where I would upload almost all the learning materials you need and share books, websites, or tips.
