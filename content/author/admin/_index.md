After working in a financial firm and become a Chartered Financial Analyst, I decided to pursue a degree in mathematics and get more trainning in computer programming. Since I am very curious and open-minded, I have also invested much of my time in reading and writing. This website was built for me to have some reflections on any subject I am interested in and share them with any one who carries the same passion. 

You can find my [cv here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1g-rm7YdzcSBivbNirdT1aIZecCMFrl8I) (Michael is my English name). Hope you will enjoy visiting this site.
