Currently, I am a student who is studying mathematics in UCD. I am expected to graduate with the Higher Diploma degree in September of 2020. After the mathematical studies, I will apply the Phd in economics, which my main research interests lie in game theory, risk shocks in macroeconomics, and network effects in Big Data era.

You can find my [cv here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1g-rm7YdzcSBivbNirdT1aIZecCMFrl8I) (Michael is my English name). Hope you will enjoy visiting this site.
