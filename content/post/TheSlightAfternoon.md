<p style="text-align:left">
Standing in front of the windowpane<br>
<br>
The tree is swinging with the secular sound of wind<br>
<br>
transforming the skeleton of umbrella, the amber of season<br>
<br>
He is trying his best to breathe the silence of this afternoon<br>
<br>
staring that tower crane<br>
<br>
sighed with gloomy weather<br>
<br>
A line is shaped with her long trendy hair<br>
<br>
connecting the view and moments with her alternative shifting of feet<br>
<br>
It's the time to move<br>
<br>
It's the time to frame that scene<br>
<br>
There isn't the starting without ending<br>
<br>
But when he turned around<br>
the heaviness of memory and desire is still there,<br>
<br>
sighed with everything left behind<br>
