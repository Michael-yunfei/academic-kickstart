<p style="text-align:left">
I was young when I left home<br>
<br>
thought I would find a way to become a man<br>
<br>
one day my friends turned back on me<br>
<br>
as we all fell in love with the same girl<br>
<br>
Lord you threw me into this paradox<br>
<br>
Hallelujah, show me the way out<br>
<br>
Hallelujah, you say you will bring me the light<br>
<br>
<br>
Living on the road with the loneliness<br>
<br>
I got the feeling of freedom and being empty<br>
<br>
Singing the song by bob dylan could not save me<br>
<br>
The books of Nietzsche are buried in the dust<br>
<br>
Lord you bring me to this world<br>
<br>
Hallelujah, show me the way out<br>
<br>
Hallelujah, you say you will bring me the light<br>
<br>
<br>
Being thirty something in a row without a house<br>
<br>
I know it's hard to make someone to feel my spirit<br>
<br>
I could not go back home without any fame in my name<br>
<br>
But how could I sell my soul in the market without trade-off<br>
<br>
Lord you set me up by losing my mind<br>
<br>
Hallelujah, show me the way out<br>
<br>
Hallelujah, you say you will bring me the light<br>
<br>
<br>
The future ahead is unsure and real<br>
<br>
I have been working hard to prepare the coming of that day<br>
<br>
they say you need money for the insurance of end<br>
<br>
That's how the pension and strike works those days<br>
<br>
Lord you will never let it go no matter what we do<br>
<br>
Hallelujah, show me the way out<br>
<br>
Hallelujah, you say you will bring me the light<br>
<br>
