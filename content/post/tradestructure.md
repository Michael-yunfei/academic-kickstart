## A Talk from Huang Qifan

I read a wechat post by the previous Chongqing mayor Huang Qifan from the China Finance 40 Forum. Huang was giving a talk on international trade in Fudan University in Shanghai. The main theme of his talk is to emphasize how the structure of international trade has changed over the last two decades from **trading final goods** to **trading intermediate goods**.

This talk is worth for me to sit down and write a blog as it summarizes the stylized facts of international trade very well. Those stylized facts include:

* International trade is the macro term for value chains and supply chains in micro level.
* In macro level, we have the balance of trade account which is related to the currency exchange and international finance.
* In micro level, all trade are mainly the activities of international firms. Those firms interacted with each other along the value chain and supply chain.
* Divisions of labor in the global scale make it possible for the big company like Apple to operate more efficient with international trade.
* In the policy level, more countries began to remove tariff and have more integrated markets, such as EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement.
* Due to those changes, unlike the early stage when most countries trade their final goods, most international firms trade their intermediate goods within many different countries. For example, apple buy screens from Korean, import mobile processors from US to China, etc.
* How should countries to design their international trade policy to gain competitive advantages and protect their core interest (such as the agriculture sectors).
* ...

## The Structure Changing of International Trade

I have kept saying that getting the stylized facts is the primary step for doing any research. By knowing what's going on in real world, then we can begin to provide the interpretations.



## Network Implications from the Stylized Facts of International Trade

Once most trades happen in the intermediate goods level, then how the network of those trades is formed becomes very important. Recently, scholars have begun to use network to study the pattern of Network. I will just list two papers, wherein one of them is by the visiting scholar Michael Konig in Konstanz:

* Chaney, T., 2014. The network structure of international trade. American Economic Review, 104(11), pp.3600-3634.
* KÃ¶nig, M.D., Battiston, S., Napoletano, M. and Schweitzer, F., 2012. The efficiency and stability of R&D networks. Games and Economic Behavior, 75(2), pp.694-713.
