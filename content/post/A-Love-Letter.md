<p style="text-align:left">
Every night, when you are sleeping<br>
<br>
I am writing letters to you from the distance<br>
<br>
Seems I am looking for the peace<br>
<br>
Composed with breath, thinking of your grace<br>
<br>
I sat on the floor by the window<br>
<br>
meditating on the first born<br>
<br>
Yes, the old God has gone, no one believes its call<br>
<br>
But, my love is so strong, connecting to the firstborn<br>
<br>
The endless memories are ruminating on the past<br>
<br>
The contradicted will are tormenting the future<br>
<br>
Everyone is surprised by the romance of time<br>
<br>
She uses a whole season to prepare for the spring<br>
<br>
No matter how cruel she has to be in the winter<br>
<br>
She is carefree for the all<br>
<br>
You have been through so many seasons<br>
<br>
Like nirvana without conscience<br>
<br>
So far, my world has your voice<br>
<br>
So far, life is no longer just memory<br>
<br>
Everything in your mind will still go to the future<br>
<br>
Every story from my past is by far for this moment<br>
<br>
Do I care the ending like I care my own payment<br>
<br>
Do I fear the future like I fear the loss of everything<br>
<br>
No, I was the firstborn of her carefree being<br>
<br>
Yes, I was the last one who can seal her endless will<br>
<br>
Yes or No, I would just bow<br>
<br>
And fight as I was the firstborn without anything in my palm<br>
</p>
