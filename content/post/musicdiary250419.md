## Discovering Alabama Shakes Band

When I was watching British comedy series - *Fleabay*, I was attracted by the song they played at the end of last episode. It's called *This Feeling* by <mark style="background-color:#F7F7F9">Alabama Shakes</mark>. I was quite excited and thinking I need try to play and sing this song with my guitar. However, it turned out that it is very difficult to do soul music with guitar unless my skills are very advanced. Unfortunately it is not the right time for me.

Here is the song by Alabama Shakes:

## Songs Written with Guitar

Of course, those songs written with Guitar originally should be easy for people like to me learn and sing at the early stage. Right now, I am practicing two songs:

* Stand By Me - Oasis
* Lucky Man - Verve

The best way to learn those songs is to listen the version with acoustic Guitar. Here are two videos I found online.

The strumming patterns of those two songs are quite similar.
