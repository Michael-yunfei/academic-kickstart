<p style="text-align:left">
The future is homogeneous in terms of uncertainties<br>
<br>
The love is heterogenous in terms of our desire<br>
<br>
I run against them with the hunger for the patience<br>
<br>
It seems there is no cure for the being<br>
<br>
To die is an moral action<br>
<br>
To live is a painful state<br>
<br>
Happiness is the delirium of peace<br>
<br>
I am not even bother to wear that armor<br>
<br>
But still might be too selfish for being pessimistic<br>
<br>
So<br>
<br>
The pendulum in my wonderland is singing<br>
<br>
The penguin in Antarctic is swinging<br>
<br>
LGBTs are busy for their flag-raising<br>
<br>
The world is there infinitely for the free-will<br>
<br>
But I still hold my breath<br>
<br>
for the time lost in the waste land <br>
<br>
for the one who used to kiss my cheek with the aura of Zeus<br>
<br>
I am waiting<br>
<br>
I am here<br>
<br>
I am longing<br>
<br>
and I am ready<br>
<br>
for the future<br>
<br>
and for your love<br>
</p>
