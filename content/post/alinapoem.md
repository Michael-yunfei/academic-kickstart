<p style="text-align:left">
I have never been to a place with harsh winter<br>
But several time, I touched the power of nature<br>
by imagining the vast of Siberia and any living creatres there<br>
<br>

The moment I know she is from Moscow<br>
My mind fles to the far north<br>
I guess she knows the meaning of snow and vodka<br>
That long lasting quiet and endurance<br>
<br>

I thought people from there must hold a tongue of submissive<br>
As you cannot fight with Russian winter, neither did Napoleon<br>
But when she speaks, her voice is full of sunshine<br>
Like the golden color of ancient Egypt<br>
<br>

There is also an element of youth and agin in her mind<br>
Bring me the beatufy of Neferneferuaten Nefertiti<br>
Concie and Composed<br>
Like the one are born to be in the centre of heart<br>
<br>

Again, I am touched by the power of our nature<br>
In the far north where Slavs settled<br>
The land nurtures not just abundant oil and mineral<br>
but also her magnet vocie, which summons the sing of musician<br>
<br>

Ancient Greek would call her a muse<br>
I just call her Alina<br>
What her calls for is not the four seasons of  Vivaldi<br>
but the concealing reflections on my life<br>
in the stereotype of Russian winter<br>
