<p style="text-align:left">
I was woke up by a dream<br>
Didn’t know how to restart in my mind stream<br>
Randomly jumped into a scene<br>
Where I was walking in the spring<br>
<br>
So true that the guitar is for a traveler<br>
And the piano is for those home lovers<br>
I realized this on that road<br>
Where I carried my guitar<br>
but imagined I would play the piano for her<br>
<br>
She is sitting in front of me with her leaves<br>
I just pose to wait the time come<br>
Outside my window, the birds are building their nest<br>
I see them picking the twigs and shifting around<br>
<br>

Their wings are flattering each other<br>
for their subtle design of home<br>
Sometimes I could watch them for the whole day<br>
So often I wish I was that bird<br>
Sing a song and build a nest for her<br>
<br>
I guess this should be enough for putting me back into my dream<br>
But my longing for her couldn’t let me be<br>
Still I don’t know what Love has done to me<br>
But I am sure it is worth living with her<br>
<br>
Her words are always short<br>
My poems are never too long<br>
Great beauties are asymmetric<br>
As I write Chinese with my right hand<br>
and English with left<br>

Will she love me back in the end<br>
A wise man told me you do not ask<br>
He was shot to death for defending this<br>
That spirit is enough for me to carry all my love<br>
No matter light or heavy<br>
Anything will have an end<br>
I am too brave to choose not to do<br>
<br>
So she named me Romeo Kennedy<br>
Shakespeare could not call me a Hamlet<br>
I am happy to being who I am<br>
I am long living for creating my life<br>
<br>
What names should I call her?<br>
What a future can I offer to her?<br>
Too much her soul mixed in my heart<br>
I could not speak<br>
Too much our time spinning on the earth<br>
I shall not waste<br>
<br>
