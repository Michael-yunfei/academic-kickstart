According to BBC, clashes have broken out between police and protesters as ["yellow vest"](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/48128818/police-fire-tear-gas-as-paris-may-day-protests-turn-violent) demonstrators and labour unions held a traditional May Day rally in Paris.

People who are interested on political movements and evolvement might want to know what's the next. After watching a talk by a professor from Renmin University of China, I would like to share some insights here. This professor is a senior fellow at the Institute of American Studies (IAS) at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS).

She/he said that Chinese government might predict the result of 2016 US Presidential Election correctly at the very early stage by counting the orders of campaign flags and banners. You can watch this vide. It is in Chinese, but it has English subtitle,

At the same time, she/he also said that experts who focus European foreign policies in China said that "yellow vest" will last for a while. Again, they use the same method: trace the key goods in this movement: yellow vest.

In my last blog, I argued that network of international trade contains a large information and can be a very promising research area. I think the stories from this blog in some sense give the evidences.
