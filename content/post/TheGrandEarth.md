<p style="text-align:left">
The grand earth carries everything<br>
no matter heavy or light<br>
no matter live or dead<br>
<br>

In a corner of spacious football pitch<br>
I could touch the vast of any continent<br>
either Africa or America<br>
<br>

You use your two feet to measure your journey<br>
In a field with the size of house<br>
You touch the soil<br>
wish to grow your own food<br>
<br>

I walked around this filed step by step<br>
time after time<br>
sometimes against the wind<br>
sometimes in the rain<br>
but all the time I am looking up the sky<br>
feel the freedom of clouds<br>
<br>

You don’t have to remind me of respecting you<br>
You don’t have to worry that my feelings might consume you<br>
True love would never become your burden<br>
<br>

So often I want to fly with a bird<br>
to see the mountain and the sea<br>
If I could not let you taste the feeling of flying<br>
at least I should help you dance with your wings<br>
<br>

You say you are like a lone wolf<br>
But I have no intention of being an alpha lion<br>
or being a grasshopper<br>
as they are either too big or too small<br>
<br>

Standing on any land<br>
I am a human being<br>
In the daytime, I labour my land with my two feet and hands<br>
At night, I lay down to watch stars and sleep<br>
</p>
