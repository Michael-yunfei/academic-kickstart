<p style="text-align:left">
Alarm is on, the memory is burning<br>
<br>
When I wake up in the morning, I don't know what I should fight for<br>
<br>
You come and go, the style is changing<br>
<br>
Sometimes it's so hard for me to end it once and for all<br>
<br>
Oh my unleashed youthful time<br>
<br>
Oh my unknown defaulted fate<br>
<br>
Anyhow I have to face it by myself<br>
<br>
Thousands of miles, the oath is broken<br>
<br>
When I see the glory of lord, I doubt how many stories hasn't been told<br>
<br>
In the late night, the old man is writing<br>
<br>
You know it's so hard for him to leave the medal<br>
<br>
shinning by the candlelight,<br>
<br>
On your frighten vigorous past<br>
<br>
Oh your flavoured mix of love and hate<br>
<br>
Anyhow you have to carry it by yourself<br>
<br>
On top of mountain, the wish was whispered<br>
<br>
When I look back my life, I don't know how I should get out of my situation<br>
<br>
On the roadmap, you talk like a know-how<br>
<br>
She knows that it would be funny if I told her you know nothing at all<br>
<br>
Oh his unbroken centered self-esteem<br>
<br>
Oh her surrounded aloof self-interest<br>
<br>
somehow all are dissolved by ourselves<br>
