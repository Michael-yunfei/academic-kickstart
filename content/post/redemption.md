>…It is one of the most deplorable traits of our strange civilization that we are still
discovering truths that are commonplace even among peoples much less advanced than
we.  This is because we have never moved in concert with the other peoples. We do not
belong to any of the great families of the human race; we are neither of the West nor of
the East, and we have not the traditions of either.  We stand, as it were, outside of time,
the universal education of mankind has not touched us…
> - Petr Chaadaev (Пётр Я́ковлевич Чаада́ев), *Philosophical Letters Addressed to a Lady (1829)*

Petr Chaadaev believed that Russian people belong neither to the West nor to the East. I am not sure this is a truth universally acknowledged. But I think it is a good starting point to discourse some words on Russian civilization.

One can get to grips with Russian culture by just talking to people who live there. If you had some chances to meet some Russians, you might feel `they are outside of time'.
