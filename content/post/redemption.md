>…It is one of the most deplorable traits of our strange civilization that we are still
discovering truths that are commonplace even among peoples much less advanced than
we.  This is because we have never moved in concert with the other peoples. We do not
belong to any of the great families of the human race; we are neither of the West nor of
the East, and we have not the traditions of either.  We stand, as it were, outside of time,
the universal education of mankind has not touched us…
> - Petr Chaadaev (Пётр Я́ковлевич Чаада́ев), *Philosophical Letters Addressed to a Lady (1829)*

Petr Chaadaev believed that Russian people belong neither to the West nor to the East. I am not sure this is a truth universally acknowledged. But I think it is a good starting point to discourse some words on Russian civilization.

One can get to grips with Russian culture by just talking to people who live there. If you had some chances to meet some Russians, you might feel 'they are outside of time'. Partially, this is because of the historical event - the collapse of the Soviet Union, which Mr Putin called 'the greatest geo-political catastrophe of the century'. After that, failure of tackling economic reforms, the bumpying journey of integrating into the world trading system dominated by Anglo-Saxons people, and recurring sanctions imposed by the sole remaining superpower, made Russian people become kind of 'outside of time' (or 'outside of trend') in terms of evolution of both economies and mentalities. Partially, it is also because of language and culture, in which East Slavs asserted Moscow is the successor of the Roman Empire. That's why they call their church 'Orthodox', which means their religions are of ancient lineage.

I found this special feature related to 'outside of time' very attractive and charming, especially one would appreciate the way in which Russian girls talk. The mix of shyness and being inquiring always pulls me back to the 'traditional age'. If you have talked to people from United States, soon you would realized what it means to be 'super modern' when topics switched from symbols of globalisation, such as Starbucks and Mcdonalds, to very recent TV dramas, like Game of Thrones, and Stranger Things.

I also touched this 'outside of time' feelings in the novel, Crime and Punishment by *Fyodor Dostoevsky*. When I reached to the end of story, several scenes stirred up my imagination and pushed me to write several poems. To phrase simply,  Raskolnikov (Раскольниковъ) means schismatic or dissenter. Schism is a split or division between strongly opposed sections or parties, caused by differences in opinion or belief. He has been struggling to find his end of identity and fate. To construct and deconstruct his being, he chose to kill some innocent people. In chapter IV of Part Five, Raskolnikov confessed his crime to the girl he loved, Sonya.

When Sonya realized that Raskolnikov was the murder, her series of reactions were very like of tsunami. Here is how Dostoevsky described:

<blockquote>
As if she were unaware of what she was doing, she jumped up; wringing her hands, she reached the middle of the room, but quickly returned and sat down next to him once again, her shoulder almost touching his. All of a sudden, as if pierced, she shuddered, cried out, and threw herself on her knees before him, not really knowing why she did so.
<br>
....
<br>
"You're so strange, Sonya-you hug me and kiss me when I just told you about that. You don't know what you're doing."<br>
"So you won't desert me, Sonya?" he asked, regarding her almost with hope.<br>
“No, no; never and nowhere!” Sonya cried, "I'll follow you, I'll follow you everywhere! Oh, Lord!... Oh, I'm so unhappy!...Why, oh, Why, oh, why didn't I know you before? Why didn't you come sooner? Oh, Lord!"
</blockquote>

At the end of this scene, Sonya convinced Raskolnikov that he should turn himself in. Here is what Sonya said:

>"What do do?" She cried, jumping up from her places; her eyes, previously full of tears, suddenly began to flash. "Stand up!" (She grabbed him by the shoulder; he got up, looking at her almost in bewilderment) "Go at once, this very minute, and stand at the crossroads, bow down, and begin by kissing the ground that you've fouled; then bow down to the entire world, all four sides, and say aloud to everyone: 'I killed!' Then God will send you life once more. Will you go? Will you?" She asked him, trembling in her whole body.

Of course, he did. He did this ceremony for his redemption. After that, he went to his sister place and told her everything, and later to his mother's place, and in the end turned himself in. When I read this, I could not stop my tears.

This scene reminds me of a very ancient Chinese story. I would just rephrase story first and then put the poem I wrote insipred by Dostoevsky.

In Song Dynasty, a noble family has raised a young lady who is fated to be loved by everyone. She was very attractive and educated with literature and arts. She has the same smile like Sonya and they say she could ease the hands of hard labour men, soothe the sin of unforgivable prisoners. From the day one when she turned adult, princes of king’s families, sons of big merchant families, scholars of top universities, vagrants of foreign lands, and of course, the poor poets, they all came to her house for pledging their love to her.

Citizens in her hometown were worried that a war might be triggered due to so many people seeking for her love. Her parents were lost like their hands had been tightened. But, no single war was started and no man was not smiling when they came out of her house.  No war happened since she had been loved by almost everyone. She was so lovable as she had the soul like Sonya had, which I summarised into a poem called *Sonya's Smile*

<p style="text-align:left">
Before her smile<br>
The folk tale has no trail<br>
The war of old tribes were fierce and wild<br>
As spent soldiers were lying in the blood<br>
The axe and sword were dancing in the air<br>
<br>
Bewildered orphans lost in the hunger<br>
Our great nature could not stand for this splendid waste<br>
Sending a young beautiful girl to the middle of battle field<br>
All dropped their hands, knelt down and touched their land<br>
<br>
A war was stopped for her beauty and kind<br>
A tale was told until the legend is heard<br>
I doubt the coming of any dwindled story<br>
Until I saw Sonya's melting disarming smile<br>
that whirled my soul in the middle of battle-field<br>

<p style="text-align:justify">
Whispers of any kind of magic were passed ears by ears when people were wonder how she responded to so many marriage proposals. No one knew how she could manage to do it until one day a vagrant read a poem she wrote:

<p style="text-align:left">
He who comes for my beauty<br>
must have a heart of fruity<br>
Without concern your duty<br>
I shall devote the tributes to amity<br>
<br>
Do not ponder over my ending<br>
Only the one who can endure himself should earn the loyalty<br>
You all are welcome to be my companion<br>
But only yourself can make yourself become a knight<br>
<br>
Write to me in your journey of life<br>
Sing to me in the middle of your night<br>
The spirit I could never turn down<br>
The love I could only be in the gratitude of your trust<br>
Stay or leave<br>
Just be yourself and I shall have a kiss with your miss<br>

This is the story I made up after reading Crime and Punishment by *Fyodor Dostoevsky*.
