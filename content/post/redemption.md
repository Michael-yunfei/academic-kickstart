>…It is one of the most deplorable traits of our strange civilization that we are still
discovering truths that are commonplace even among peoples much less advanced than
we.  This is because we have never moved in concert with the other peoples. We do not
belong to any of the great families of the human race; we are neither of the West nor of
the East, and we have not the traditions of either.  We stand, as it were, outside of time,
the universal education of mankind has not touched us…
> - Petr Chaadaev (Пётр Я́ковлевич Чаада́ев), *Philosophical Letters Addressed to a Lady (1829)*

Petr Chaadaev believed that Russian people belong neither to the West nor to the East. I am not sure this is a truth universally acknowledged. But I think it is a good starting point to discourse some words on Russian civilization.

One can get to grips with Russian culture by just talking to people who live there. If you had some chances to meet some Russians, you might feel 'they are outside of time'. Partially, this is because of the historical event - the collapse of the Soviet Union, which Mr Putin called 'the greatest geo-political catastrophe of the century'. After that, failure of tackling economic reforms after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the bumpying journey of integrating into the world trading system dominated by Anglo-Saxons people, and recurring sanctions imposed by the sole remaining superpower, made Russian people become kind of 'outside of time' (or 'outside of trend') in terms of evoluation of both economies and mentalities. Partially, it is also because of language and culture, in which East Slavs asserted Moscow is the successor of the Roman Empire. That's why they call their church 'Orthodox', which means their religions are of ancient lineage.

I found this special feature related to 'outside of time' very attractive and charming, especially one would appreciate the way in which Russian girls talk. The mix of shyness and being inquiring always pulls me back to the 'traditional age'. If you have talked to people from United States, soon you would realized what it means to be 'super modern' when topics switched from symobals of globalisation, such as Starbucks and Mcdonalds, to very recent TV dramas, like Game of Thones, and Stranger Things.

I also touched this 'outside of time' feelings in the novel, Crime and Punishment by *Fyodor Dostoevsky*. When I reached to the end of story, several secens stirred up my imagination and pushed me to write several poems. To phrase simply,  Raskolnikov (Раскольниковъ) means schismatic or dissenter. Schism is a split or division between strongly opposed sections or parties, caused by differences in opinion or belief. He has been struggling to find his end of identity and fate. To construct and deconstruct his being, he chose to kill some innocent people. In chapter IV of Part Five, Raskolnikov confessed his crime to the girl he loved, Sonya.

When Sonya realized that Raskolnikov was the murder, her series of reactions were very like of tsunami. Here is how Dostoevsky described:

<blockquote>
As if she were unware of what she was doing, she jumped up; wringing her hands, she reached the middle of the room, but quickly returned and sat down next to him once again, her shoulder almost touching his. All of a sudden, as if pierced, she shuddered, cried out, and threw herself on her knees before him, not really knowing why she did so.
<br>
....
<br>
"You're so strange, Sonya-you hug me and kiss me when I just told you about that. You don't know what you're doing."
"So you won't desert me, Sonya?" he asked, regarding her almost with hope.
“No, no; never and nowhere!” Sonya cried, "I'll follow you, I'll follow you everywhere! Oh, Lord!... Oh, I'm so unhappy!...Why, oh, Why, oh, why didn't I know you before? Why didn't you come sooner? Oh, Lord!"
</blockquote>

At the end of this scene, Sonya conviced Raskolnikov that he should turn himself in. Here is what Sonya said:

>"What do do?" She cried, jumping up from her places; her eyes, previously full of tears, suddenly began to flash. "Stand up!" (She grabbed him by the shoulder; he got up, looking at her almost in bewilderment) "Go at once, this very minute, and stand at the crossroads, bow down, and begin by kissing the ground that you've fouled; then bow down to the entire world, all four sides, and say aloud to everyone: 'I killed!' Then God will send you life once more. Will you go? Will you?" She asked him, trembling in her whole body.

Of course, he did. He did this ceremony for his redemption. After that, he went to his sister place and told her everything, and later to his mother's place, and in the end turned himself in. When I read this, I could not stop my tears.
