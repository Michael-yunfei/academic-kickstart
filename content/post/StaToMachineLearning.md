With the rise of artificial intelligence, knowing how to programme is quite essential for most students how are doing science degree. We are seeing that more and more students from economic department are enrolled in the Machine Learning course world widely. Meanwhile, trained future statisticians are exploring to become a professional data scientist. However, both economic students and statistic students might have very mixed feeling on Machine Learning Modules. On one hand, you might feel the contents from machine learning are very familiar to you. For instance, the logistic regression for classification has been covered and practiced from both econometric and statistic classes. However, on the other hand, you might be lost temporarily when you heard about gradient descent for risk optimization.

How should economic and statistic student break into Machine Learning? This blog presents some thoughts on this question. To avoid the plagiarism, I have to declare that all material used in this blog are taken from the classical course by [Andrew Ng](https://see.stanford.edu/course/cs229), unless ortherwise stated.

## Go for Broad View

To get the gist of machine learning, we need have the broad view. As a subject of AI module, machine learning is the study on training computer to learn the certain tasks by feeding the large dataset. If one method can be only used to solve problems related to time series dataset, it should not be called machine learning. Therefore, when we study machine learning, we want to have the very broad view or very general method to cover different datasets, such as cross-sectional, panel and time series dataset, ect,.
