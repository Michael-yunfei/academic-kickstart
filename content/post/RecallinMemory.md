<p style="text-align:left">
Recalling something in memory<br>
<br>
is like measuring the time by scrolling it up,<br>
<br>
Your nerve has been warmed up<br>
<br>
by being surprised how things can change in the life<br>
<br>
The moment you used to seize<br>
<br>
The certain flavour you used to attach<br>
<br>
are waving lights in that disappeared world<br>
<br>
Suddenly, you feel you are growing up<br>
<br>
but that consciousness is so blur and not fixed,<br>
<br>
which pulls you back to the dimension of time<br>
<br>
It is full of layers, like our emotions<br>
<br>
I know that I have been swimming in that river for such a long time<br>
<br>
All the details that used to help me to record<br>
<br>
All the conservations that used to help me to recall<br>
<br>
They are always there<br>
<br>
To forget is to leave something behind<br>
<br>
To not recall in memory is to let it die in the time<br>
<br>
Here and there, now and then<br>
<br>
Will be myself also lost,<br>
<br>
when I stop recalling in the time<br>
</p>
