Tiredness in the morning rain<br>
<br>
Could not find my crane<br>
<br>
I used to love a girl called Jane<br>
<br>
She left me for living in the fast lane<br>
<br>
great expectation in the dream<br>
<br>
where is the theme of my life<br>
<br>
you are not the kind of supreme<br>
<br>
but always trying your best to be in the team<br>
<br>
Time is worn out in the mind<br>
<br>
I want to be assgined to steal the fire<br>
<br>
So I can die for saving your humankind<br>
<br>
Even though to roll the stone in sisyphus way<br>
<br>
Yes you do like to mark your being<br>
<br>
to shake the mountain and flying in the sky<br>
<br>
where people used to defy<br>
<br>
you said you would make them to feel right<br>
<br>
I turned away from my past<br>
<br>
leaving you there to have your fight<br>
<br>
At long last, I am (still) your friend<br>
<br>
But it's the time to leave it behind and define myself<br>
