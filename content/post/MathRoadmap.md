To fulfill myself, I came to University College Dublin to study mathematics in September. Once the new semester started, I just dived into it. The more I learned from professors in mathematics department, the eager I am for more advanced knowledge. On one hand, this makes me enthusiastic and energetic on studying mathematics. On the other hand, it also makes become anxious on learning process and future achievements as it looks like the situation that life time is limited but knowledge there is infinite. What should I do then? I believe that a conceivable road map is essential.

## Math Major Roadmaps from MIT

For almost anything I do, I don't like the feeling of being wandering around. It's always good to be aware of your situation and process. That's why I found the following roadmaps from MIT. It gives you the direction of studying mathematics. For instance, say you want to focus on probability and measure theory, what kind of subjects you should study and then build up your required skills. Each roadmap consists of three tiers:

* __Tier1__: Introductory courses with few prerequisites.
* __Tier2__: More advanced classes for students who have mastered several tier-1 classes.
* __Tier3__: The most advanced classes, often beginning graduate-level subjects, for students who have mastered many tier-1 and tier-2 classes.

MIT lists roadmaps based on two categories: pure mathematics and applied mathematics. I will present one of the roadmaps I am interested on rather than listing all of them. You check the full version of this roadmap through this [link](http://math.mit.edu/academics/undergrad/roadmaps.php).

Analysis and Geometry:

* Tier 1: Real Analysis; Linear Algebra; Algebra
* Tier 2: Complex Analysis; Fourier Analysis; Functional Analysis; Geometry; Differential Equations; etc.
* Tier 3: Measure Theory and Analysis; Differential Analysis; etc.

## Math Roadmaps for Economics Students

As a student who wants to apply PHD of economics and also is passionate about math, personally I want to accomplish the following missions within the year of studying mathematics in UCD:

* Gain knowledge and skills up to the level of being prepared to be a student of graduate school in mathematics.

* Have the solid training and deep understanding in the core areas of mathematics: analysis, algebra, probability and statistics.

According to the structure of major I enrolled right now, I made this target timeline:
