To fulfill myself, I came to University College Dublin to study mathematics in September. Once the new semester started, I just dived into it. The more I learned from professors in mathematics department, the eager I am for more advanced knowledge. On one hand, this makes me enthusiastic and energetic on studying mathematics. On the other hand, it also makes become anxious on learning process and future achievements as it looks like the situation that life time is limited but knowledge there is infinite. What should I do then? I believe that a conceivable road map is essential.

## Math Major Roadmaps from MIT

For almost anything I do, I don't like the feeling of being wandering around. It's always good to be aware of your situation and process. That's why I found the following roadmaps from MIT. It gives you the direction of studying mathematics. For instance, say you want to focus on probability and measure theory, what kind of subjects you should study and then build up your required skills. Each roadmap consists of three tiers:

* __Tier 1__: Introductory courses with few prerequisites.
* __Tier 2__: More advanced classes for students who have mastered several tier-1 classes.
* __Tier 3__: The most advanced classes, often beginning graduate-level subjects, for students who have mastered many tier-1 and tier-2 classes.

MIT lists roadmaps based on two categories: pure mathematics and applied mathematics. I will present one of the roadmaps I am interested on rather than listing all of them. You check the full version of this roadmap through this [link](http://math.mit.edu/academics/undergrad/roadmaps.php).

Analysis and Geometry

* __Tier 1__: Real Analysis; Linear Algebra; Algebra
* __Tier 2__: Complex Analysis; Fourier Analysis; Functional Analysis; Geometry; Differential Equations; etc.
* __Tier 3__: Measure Theory and Analysis; Differential Analsysi; etc.
