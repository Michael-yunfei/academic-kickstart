When we read a book or a letter, different people can have different interpretations. That's why they say the writing is dead from the author and reborn for the readers once it is done. It is same for this one. Though it is an open letter, it is still very personal if the reader was told this one is written specifically for her/him.

You know the weather is not that good today. I thought it was not a bad idea to sit down to finish the letter I have been talking for a while. Initially, I intended to push both of us to have the reflections on our life. I am not good at talking. I sill believe that it's very difficult to discourse at the topics we are interested within the limited time. Considering the situation we are in, is it still possible to have a consistent and transparent mind? You said you were tired to submit the assignments and wanted to enjoy the learning of knowledge. Of course, I could argue with you that perhaps it is better to be pushed to learn something just like the way you argued with me.

But human being is not living for having arguments. Of course, we are special because of language and logic. But what's the purpose and criterion of being arguing or giving reason? Anyone who knowns a little bit philosophy would mention dialectics. “Dialectics” is a term used to describe a method of philosophical argument that involves some sort of contradictory process between opposing sides.
