When we read a book or a letter, different people can have different interpretations. That's why they say the writing is dead from the author and reborn for the readers once it is done. It is same for this one. Though it is an open letter, it is still very personal if the reader was told this one is written specifically for her/him.

You know the weather is not that good today. I thought it was not a bad idea to sit down to finish the letter I have been talking for a while. Initially, I intended to push both of us to have the reflections on our life. I am not good at talking. I sill believe that it's very difficult to discourse at the topics we are interested within the limited time. Considering the situation we are in, is it still possible to have a consistent and transparent mind? You said you were tired to submit the assignments and wanted to enjoy the learning of knowledge. Of course, I could argue with you that perhaps it is better to be pushed to learn something just like the way you argued with me.

But human being is not living for having arguments. Of course, we are special because of language and logic. But what's the purpose and criterion of being arguing or giving reason? Anyone who knowns a little bit philosophy would mention dialectics. “Dialectics” is a term used to describe a method of philosophical argument that involves some sort of contradictory process between opposing sides.

Taking the 'assignments talk' as an example, I can give some good reasons in support of having assignments is better for you. However, I can also give some evidences to support the opposite side. Students who graduate from business school might suggest you to draw a table to do SWOT (strength, weakness, opportunities and threats) analysis. We can laugh at SWOT at first. But, we also have to acknowledge that SWOT at least provides a way to solve the issue of dialectics. What do I mean when I talk about the issue of dialectics. Let's take a look at the following table.

|Arguments | Evidence | Evaluate | Making Decision |
| -------- | :--------: | -------- | --------------- |
|Having Assignments | Certain pressures can make us become more competitive | Am I tough enough | Yes - do it; No - Leave it |
|     | Assignments train us better | Do I need training? | Yes - do it; No - Leave it|
|     | etc.. |
|Not Having Assignments | Freedom releases the true passion | Do I have strong passion | Yes - do it; No - Leave it |
|     | Self-dancing gives better rhythm with enjoyment | Am I self-discipline |  Yes - do it; No - Leave it|
|     | etc.. |
|Human beings are so immense that it is so difficult to make decisions
