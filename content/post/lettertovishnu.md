When we read a book or a letter, different people can have different interpretations. That's why they say the writing is dead from the author and reborn for the readers once it is done. It is same for this one. Though it is an open letter, it is still very personal if the reader was told this one is written specifically for her/him.

You know the weather is not that good today. I thought it was not a bad idea to sit down to finish the letter I have been talking for a while. Initially, I intended to push both of us to have the reflections on our life. I am not good at talking. I sill believe that it's very difficult to discourse at the topics we are interested within the limited time. Considering the situation we are in, is it still possible to have a consistent and transparent mind? You said you were tired to submit the assignments and wanted to enjoy the learning of knowledge. Of course, I could argue with you that perhaps it is better to be pushed to learn something just like the way you argued with me.

But human being is not living for having arguments. Of course, we are special because of language and logic. But what's the purpose and criterion of being arguing or giving reason? Anyone who knowns a little bit philosophy would mention dialectics. “Dialectics” is a term used to describe a method of philosophical argument that involves some sort of contradictory process between opposing sides.

Taking the 'assignments talk' as an example, I can give some good reasons in support of having assignments is better for you. However, I can also give some evidences to support the opposite side. Students who graduate from business school might suggest you to draw a table to do SWOT (strength, weakness, opportunities and threats) analysis. We can laugh at SWOT at first. But, we also have to acknowledge that SWOT at least provides a way to solve the issue of dialectics. What do I mean when I talk about the issue of dialectics. Let's take a look at the following table.

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Arguments</th>
    <th>Evidence</th>
    <th>Evaluate</th>
    <th> Making Decisions</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Having Assignments</td>
    <td>Certain pressures can make us become more competitive </td>
    <td> Am I tough enough</td>
    <td>Yes - do it; No - Leave it</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> </td>
    <td>Assignments train us better</td>
    <td>Do I need training?</td>
    <td>Yes - do it; No - Leave it</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td> </td>
  <td colspan=3> etc. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Not Having Assignments</td>
    <td>Freedom releases the true passion</td>
    <td>Do I have strong passion</td>
    <td>Yes - do it; No - Leave it</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> </td>
    <td>Self-dancing gives better rhythm with enjoyment</td>
    <td>Am I self-discipline?</td>
    <td>Yes - do it; No - Leave it</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td> </td>
  <td colspan=3> etc. </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Now, you can see that it is not that easy to have the optimized solution for most problems in our life. *If the logic can go on both sides, what's the right or wrong judgement*? It is not surprising that the relativism can rise in the global scale. For thousands of years, Philosophers are trying to solve this issue. Here are some famous quotes.

> Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions - Hume

“[…W]e can perceive no limits to the extension of our knowledge. The light dove cleaving in free flight the thin air, whose resistance it feels, might imagine that her movements would be far more free and rapid in airless space. Just in the same way did Plato, abandoning <mark style = "background-color:#e0efda">the world of sense</mark> because of the narrow limits it sets to the understanding, venture upon the wings of ideas beyond it, into the void space of pure intellect. He did not reflect that he made no real progress by all his efforts; for he met with no resistance which might serve him for a support, as it were, whereon to rest, and on which he might apply his powers, in order to let the intellect acquire momentum for its progress” (B 9). - Kant

Since logic is like a cycle, all judgements will be pinned down the <mark style = "background-color:#F67770">likeness</mark>. Likeness is the bitter sweet. At this moment, you might want to check the lyrics from *Bitter Sweet Symphony*:

<p style="text-align:center">
Cause it's a bittersweet symphony, that's life <br>
Trying make ends meet <br>
You're a slave to money then you die <br>
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down <br>
You know the one that takes you to the places <br>
Where all the veins meet yeah <br>
<br>
No change, I can change <br>
I can change, I can change <br>
But I'm here in my mould <br>
I am here in my mould <br>
But I'm a million different people <br>
From one day to the next <br>
I can't change my mould <br>
No, no, no, no, no <br>
Have you ever been down?
</p>

At the place where all the veins meet, what should we do for our life? Again, philosophers have given so many answers, some are good and some are bad. The recent one is *Martin Heidegger*. You see I am almost again lose the theme we should talk on - *assignments*. In the world where everyone is so practical (especially me), I have to come back to give the statements right now. Otherwise, I will lose my readers very soon.

I will not expand the volumes of philosophy by Heidegger, but just give my reflections on this very practical issue. Let me start a quote by myself.

> By the time people realise logic can form a cycle and being useless to give the judgement and motivation, likeness and passion become the last refuge sought desperately by us - Michael

But will the likeness, the word of sense and passion give us the rescue? I don't think so as artists are always rare. Remember you quoted the Buddha saying that everything is change, especially our feelings. People who like <mark style="background-color:#D0CB77">Van Gogh</mark> can endure the alienation of family and society and still love the world are very rare. But we are all the same. In the end, it's the courage, strength and love that make us being a decent person.

So, forget all those logic and reasons supporting or discording decisions. It does not matter. Forget all those likeness, passions and enjoyment pushing or dragging your actions. It does not matter. Ask yourself: should I kill myself or not?

**If not**, then I will hold my love and hate for almost everything, and try the best I can in my life path. Anyone who has this determination for death can do anything she/he seeks to do. To be or not to be, it's a question. To live or not to live, it's an action.  

You know, I like Bob Dylan. Listen to the following song by him. And interpret his lyrics with the theme of this letter. Then you will understand why he can win Nobel Prize.
