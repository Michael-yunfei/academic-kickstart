His journey normally starts from autumn<br>
A season of harvest<br>
Romance and affection arise from bottom<br>
A layer of target<br>
He met her in a winding path full of colourful leaves<br>
<br>
Winter comes with the warmness of love<br>
When the snow make the world quiet<br>
She runs on the field with happiness of tears<br>
Time  stops there like that mighty white<br>
He hugs her from the back wishing to protect<br>
<br>
Like elves usually choose spring to dance<br>
Their lives begin to grow fractions with all the power of our earth<br>
So many deals are betrayed when yelling covers up the singing of birds<br>
So many nights are mingled with goodness and foul force<br>
<br>
Both she and he sweats in the summer<br>
tempered by temperature<br>
Both love and hatred are all out<br>
eagerly for the eagerness<br>
The door has been shut down<br>
The window is waiting to be opened<br>
A story has not been told until now<br>
<br>
