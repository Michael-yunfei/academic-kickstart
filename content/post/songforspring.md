I love our great nature. Spring is one of my favourite. I have written so many songs on Spring. I would like to make a collection here.

The first one is called *Your Young Time Is Here*.  The intro based on guitar for this song is like the preamble of spring, I like it a lot. Here is the lyrics:

<p style="text-align:left; font-family:Courier New">
The sun, the cloud, the spring is here <br>
Your smile, your heart, your young time is here <br>
ain't no space to feel down <br>
ain't no space to fade away <br>
The day, the night, the winter is gone <br>
My past, my future, my old time is here <br>
ain't no space to go up <br>
ain't no space to turn away <br>
(guitar solo) <br>
I  wanna fly <br>
wanna go back my home <br>
wanna travel around the world to the death
 </p>

A year ago, I wrote a song called *Winter Is Gone* when I was in Nottingham. I still remember that moment. The breeze is on the face, suddenly I got this singing:

<p style="text-align:left; font-family:Courier New">
When the winter is gone <br>
My heart is light <br>
Birds are flying around, fishes are dancing with my songs <br>
Where have you ever been, my dear friends <br>
Did you really travel a lot <br>
Have you ever really seen the world <br>
Have you ever really listened to people <br>
Who is calling you, call you go back home <br>
Who is leaving you, leave you along again <br>
This is the not last year I feel younger <br>
Even though I am becoming old <br>
What are you busy for today <br>
What are you planning for future <br>
Who is calling you, call you go back home <br>
Who is leaving you, leave you along again
</p>
