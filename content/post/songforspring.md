I love our great nature. Spring is one of my favourite. I have written so many songs on Spring. I would like to make a collection here.

The first one is called <mark style = "background-color:#e0efda">Your Young Time Is Here</mark>.  The intro based on guitar for this song is like the preamble of spring, I like it a lot. Here is the lyrics:

 <pre>

The sun, the cloud, the spring is here

Your smile, your heart, your young time is here

ain't no space to feel down

ain't no space to fade away

The day, the night, the winter is gone

My past, my future, my old time is here

ain't no space to go up

ain't no space to turn away

...(guitar solo)

I  wanna fly

wanna go back my home

wanna travel around the world to the death
 </pre>

A year ago, I wrote a song called <mark style = "background-color:#e0efda">Winter Is Gone</mark> when I was in Nottingham. I still remember that moment. The breeze is on the face, suddenly I got the this singing:

<pre>

When the winter is gone

My heart is light

Birds are flying around, fishes are dancing with my songs

Where have you ever been, my dear friends

Did you really travel a lot

Have you ever really seen the world

Have you ever really listened to people

Who is calling you, call you go back home

Who is leaving you, leave you along again

This is the not last year I feel younger

Even though I am becoming old

What are you busy for today

What are you planning for future

Who is calling you, call you go back home

Who is leaving you, leave you along again

</pre>
