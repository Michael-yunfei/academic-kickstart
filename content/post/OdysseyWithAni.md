In an interview, Neil Young once said that you don't write great songs, you could only fish them. Similar points have been made by Bob Dylan, who said he felt that the devil has taken his body when he wrote his greatest songs. This is so true, you can never write a good one by sitting down and meditating. When I just played guitar with certain beats, and then some melody comes to my mind. This gives you certain incentives. With my longing for Ani, then suddenly some words like `No, I cannot deny that I love her the most, but she is not near', were formed. The next thing is to use all your imagination and enjoying of rhythm to type the rest of words. Here we go, then:

<p style="text-align:left">
Yes, it is true that old god has gone<br>
<br>
No one believes his call<br>
<br>
They sell his statue<br>
<br>
for buying the new virtue<br>
<br>
Our grate nature has been left alone<br>
<br>
No, I cannot deny that I love her the most<br>
<br>
But she is not near<br>
<br>
The wind at her home<br>
<br>
is hunting my ear<br>
<br>
Our great nature is carefree for the all<br>
<br>
Oh, you used to sing and dance in the wild<br>
<br>
living like a firstborn<br>
<br>
when the rain is pouring down from the top<br>
<br>
your clown cannot even stop<br>
<br>
Out great nature again, is laughing at you around<br>
<br>
Inside the Rhode Island, there are too many her footprints<br>
<br>
But I can still count<br>
<br>
He kneels down to kiss the land<br>
<br>
Hope his love will not be banned<br>
<br>
our great nature again is creating something new<br>
<br>
Beyond the end of word, she is sailing for another sun<br>
<br>
King Peter is on her boat<br>
<br>
when the darkness has not been defined<br>
<br>
meaning of light is yet crucified<br>
<br>
Our great nature again is playing with the loop<br>
<br>
Oh, you try so hard to jump outside the door<br>
<br>
running with you homeless dog<br>
<br>
When the money returned from the bond<br>
<br>
cannot even buy you a bone<br>
<br>
Our great nature is on her own<br>
<br>
