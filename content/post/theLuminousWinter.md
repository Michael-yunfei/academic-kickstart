<p style="text-align:left; font-family:Courier New">
The street is hustle and bustle<br>
You passing through the crowd<br>
Where the scarfs are dancing with the wind, my view is broad<br>
Where the colours are falling, your breath is crystal<br>
Oh mercy of life, my beacon is still there<br>
Oh mercy of time, your cup of coffee is still warm<br>
The world is shifting in the morning of luminous winter <br>
My mind is making the symphonies with the miss of your mild<br>
I saw gypsies are heading somewhere on the bike<br>
such a vivid face, such an exotic flee<br>
What is like of this luminous winter in your moment<br>
What is like of our aging at the edge of your sense<br>
Should this mix of coldness and clarity be as long as the long night?<br>
Should that settlement of dust and will be up and down like our own life?<br>
Oh mercy of our nature<br>
Oh mercy of our love<br>
Let the air of winter fill the vacuum of our soul
Let the one by chosen stop the unknown, like it snows in the luminous winter
 </p>
