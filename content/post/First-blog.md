## Hello world

This is my first blog, just want to see what's going on

Most commands for writing the blog through github and hugo are similar with R-markdown. Of course, they are all markdown languages. we can use __bold__ and *italic*.


## Try the list

we can list things:

* first one
* second one

## Add the figure

we can add the figure

{{< figure library="1" src="london.jpg" title="London" >}}


## Add youtube video

Here we go

{{<youtube qeZR3g3G8KA>}}

## Highlight codes

we can highlight the code like this way:

```python
# Example of code highlighting
input_string_var = input("Enter some data: ")
print("You entered: {}".format(input_string_var))
```

## Type math

Now, suppose we want to type equations

$$f(k;p\_0^\*) = \begin{cases} p\_0^\* & \text{if }k=1, \\\\\\
1-p\_0^\* & \text {if }k=0.\end{cases}$$

## Type Chinese

你也可以输入中文
