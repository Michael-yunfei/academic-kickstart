<p style="text-align:left">
He who likes to steal the time from the light<br>
<br>
by scripting his mind and soul on the paper<br>
<br>
staring the shadow of pen, the sphere of space, entrenching  in the echoing silence<br>
<br>
His body is twisting and lying in the bed<br>
<br>
Pulled out all his strength, he finished the last time, and fell asleep again<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
He woke up, touched the time he stole by reading this poem in mind<br>
<br>
All the dreams and reflections are going on<br>
<br>
The neighbor's dog is barking<br>
<br>
The raven on the roof is standing<br>
<br>
Soon, it flees<br>
<br>
I turned my head to the right<br>
<br>
The light reveals and reflects on the wall<br>
<br>
There is a day ahead of me<br>
<br>
There is one life ahead of being<br>
<br>
But the door is still not open<br>
<br>
nor is knocked by any forecast or prophecy<br>
<br>
He who likes to steal the time from the light<br>
<br>
is incarcerated by it<br>
<br>
long before the death<br>
<br>
long before her arrival<br>
</p>
