The famous motto - Correlation does not imply causality - keeps haunting economists, especially when it comes to the identification and estimation of peer effects in social networks. On one hand, similarities (either on micro or macro-level) begets friendship. On the other hand, the interaction or formation of friendship within social network also affect behaviors of agents. A perfect way to identify and estimate the peer effects is to run a random experiment that can isolate the peer effects from other factors. However, this is not feasible in the real world.

With the dataset called *Panel Study of Cologne Gymnasium Students (KGP)*, I try to model the identification and estimation of peer effects with structural examination of network formation.
