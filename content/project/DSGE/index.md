After 2008 financial crisis, a growing strand of research is focusing on the effects of risk shock (or uncertainty/volatility shock). Following the work by Fernández- Villaverde et al. (2011), Gilchrist and Zakrajšek (2012) and Christiano et al. (2014), this paper built up a compact DSGE model with bond yield spread to study the propagation and quantitative effects of risk shocks. The results show the risk shock plays the major role in term of explaining the output fluctuations. By running different simulations, the DSGE model in this paper can show how the central bank ended up with the zero lower bound situations when facing the heighten uncertainty after 2008 financial crisis. The results show that the comovements of output and inflation (both drop) responding to the volatility shock generate the trade-off for central banks between responding to financial crisis immediately and smoothly.

For the full paper and coding to replicate the paper, you can visit my [Github Network Repository](https://github.com/Michael-yunfei/DSGE). *Warning: until now, the dynare code and working papers are still missing in this repository*, I will add them after my supervisor finishing my assessment.
